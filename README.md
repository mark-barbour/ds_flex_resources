# Useful Resources

## Getting Started
Welcome to the Data Science Flex Discord Github Repo! Here are some useful resources to help you get started and stay on track!


## Events
There is a calendar of upcoming events in your [Canvas](https://learning.flatironschool.com/) Homeroom as well as in [Base](https://base.flatironschool.com/events). 

### Office Hours
These events are open forums for you to attend with any questions, obstacles, or feedback. These are on a first-come-first-serve basis, and you are welcome to join them at any time during the hour. Please be mindful of joining with your mic muted here, as well, to minimize disrupting anyone who is actively seeking help in the channel. It is also helpful to join sometime in the first 30 mins to ensure that when an Instructor is available, they have enough time to assist. If you simply have a quick question, also feel free to post in the chat. Sometimes we can just provide a quick resource or answer to keep things moving efficiently for everyone!

### Career Services Events
These events are hosted to give students helpful content in each phase and set you up for success post-graduation. They cover topics such as "Embracing Your Professional Tech Identity" and "Networking: Start Conversations and Cultivate Connections", as well as an open forum to get assistance with your Phase 2 Linkedin and Phase 4 Technical Resume assignments. These two assigments are mandatory, so getting feedback and assistance are useful if you have questions or obstacles. It is also a great way to get introduced to the Career Services team, who will continue to support you post-graduation.

## Tutorial Videos
[Here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyegY76QmnvYTTdLuX4JF7Vq6kKFTxm8a&si=49g1uOeZoFJV7v2b) is a playlist of useful videos that can help you get started and address some common initial obstacles such as creating a [Github PAT [2:28]](https://youtu.be/AAsrZcV45d8?si=GrvyRcD34DLzErMW), [Working Around Local Issues with Colab [4:58]](https://youtu.be/bLURfkSXnGw?si=MdWrhaJbPdfnqCG0), and [Completing Labs [6:16]](https://youtu.be/iW1wgOx4t1o?si=xcqXrIoj_HSed1Gp).

## Grading Rubrics/Checklists
To find a Project Review Rubric and Checklist, please visit the "Project Description" assignment in Canvas for the phase you are in for your specific Cohort. Under the "Grading" section, there is a breakdown of the Rubric. There is also a Checklist linked in Canvas that appears as a Google Doc. It can also be helpful to view this [Project Example](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template/tree/example-mvp) to get some starter ideas. For your first project, you can also view this [Phase 1 Project Setup [16:27]](https://youtu.be/xOoCd5VBzXw?si=kOL0GbK4s9vsbZz0) tutorial on YouTube.

For your convenience, I have created a ***SPREADSHEET VERSION*** of the Rubric and Checklist, which I ***HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING*** for managing your projects. For your convenience, here is a link to each phase:

 * [Phase 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LF0ndyGO21w53yip1-mB8OwkNmG5yvsSegAOTNvkP1s/edit?usp=sharing)
 * [Phase 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13bcn3Jsxxm7NkG3rre4DTOEg0RGMEI_wYVmHN8U6pi0/edit?usp=sharing)
 * [Phase 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ctdmWm4bo-Q3kfth9slfJdni3RJdXDV3aPV3yys3Cc/edit?usp=sharing)
 * [Phase 4](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nSzqa6yBQyImY-HSSYIuyHUcNixPlVmg2R7G05z1ieI/edit?usp=sharing)
 * [Phase 5](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eopuCxJ4rZC5DMz2phsSQTuOyV5g5WJkiZw7_E3aLoA/edit?usp=sharing)
 
I also recommend using a project management framework such as [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining). This is the framework our Checklist is built from, and generally what is used in industry for managing data projects.

## Scheduling Links

**UPDATE** I will be out from 07/16 to 07/23 and will be back on the 24th. If you need to schedule a 1:1 or Project Review during that time, please use Morgan's scheduling links ([1:1]((https://calendly.com/morgan-jones-ds/1-1-session-with-morgan), [Project Reviews](https://calendly.com/morgan-jones-ds/ds-flex-project-review-with-morgan)).

### [30 Min 1:1](https://calendly.com/flex_booking_mark/one_on_one)
These sessions are for any questions, feedback, roadblocks, or just general face-to-face meetings with your instructor.

### [45 Min Project Review](https://calendly.com/flex_booking_mark/project_reviews) 
These sessions are for evaluating your phase projects and are assessments of your final work for each project. The first few minutes will be used for presenting, I will ask you some questions as the stakeholder, then give you feedback on your deliverables. Please be prepared with your project repo, your presentation software, the ability to screenshare with Audio/Video working in Zoom and camera on. To avoid technical issues, I recommend doing a fresh restart on your computer and only having up the relevant applications and documents for your project review. This will ensure good use of time and minimize rescheduling.
