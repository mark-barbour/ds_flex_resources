# Useful Resources

## Getting Started
Welcome to the Data Science Flex Discord Github Repo! Here are some useful resources to help you get started and stay on track!


## Guided Practices, Office Hours, & Career Services Events
There is a calendar of upcoming events in your [Canvas](https://learning.flatironschool.com/) Homeroom as well as in [Base](https://base.flatironschool.com/events). 

### Guided Practices
These events are essentially a mini-lecture on a specific topic. They generally start 5 minutes after the posted time to give people a buffer to attend. If you are a little late, no sweat, please just be mindful as you join and ensure your mic is initially muted to minimize any disruptions as you enter. If you have any questions, please feel free to unmute throughout the Guided Practice. You can review some of the Guided Practice content [here](https://github.com/mark-barbour/ds-flex). 

### Office Hours
These events are open forums for you to attend with any questions, obstacles, or feedback. These are on a first-come-first-serve basis, and you are welcome to join them at any time during the hour. Please be mindful of joining with your mic muted here, as well, to minimize disrupting anyone who is actively seeking help in the channel. It is also helpful to join sometime in the first 30 mins to ensure that when an Instructor is available, they have enough time to assist. If you simply have a quick question, also feel free to post in the chat. Sometimes we can just provide a quick resource or answer to keep things moving efficiently for everyone!

### Career Services Events
These events are hosted to give students helpful content in each phase and set you up for success post-graduation. The cover topics such as "Embracing Your Professional Tech Identity" and "Networking: Start Conversations and Cultivate Connections", as well as an open forum to get assistance with your Phase 2 Linkedin and Phase 4 Technical Resume assignments. These two assigments are mandatory, so getting feedback and assistance are useful if you have questions or obstacles. It is also a great way to get introduced to the Career Services team, who will continue to support you post-graduation.

## Grading Rubrics/Checklists
To find a Project Review Rubric and Checklist, please visit the "Project Description" assignment in Canvas for the phase you are in for your specific Cohort. Under the "Grading" section, there is a "Rubric and Checklist Spreadsheet" link specified in that section that corresponds to each specific phase for each Cohort's Curriculum Version. It can also be helpful to view this [Project Example](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template/tree/example-mvp) to get some starter ideas. For your first project, you can also view this [Phase 1 Project Setup [16:27]](https://youtu.be/xOoCd5VBzXw?si=kOL0GbK4s9vsbZz0) tutorial on YouTube.
